An expandable mod is suitable for users who have already created ERCF.
This is the approach I came up with to address the issue of gear shaft bending that occurred while applying the push mod.


The assembly is simple and uses M3 20mm screws. Please measure and cut the 2020 profile to the appropriate length for each individual.
